title: About
---

With over two decades of multidisciplinary experience, I bring a unique blend of expertise across technology, education, and wellness. After a brief diversion to attend law school and be admitted to the California Bar, my professional path has primarily focused on product management. While the vast majority of that has been in more technical realms, developing technical products for technical customers, it's also included developing consumer-facing products and services. Along the way, I have also worked in fitness and nutrition coaching, academic tutoring, career consulting, copyediting, and IT support. That range of experience gives me a well-rounded perspective on how to help individuals and organizations function at their best.

I'm deeply process-oriented by nature--not because I fetishize structure for its own sake, but because I believe intentional systems are what make long-term success sustainable. Whether I’m designing a digital product, coaching a client toward better health, or helping someone write a résumé that actually reflects their strengths, I approach every problem by understanding the context, identifying leverage points, and focusing on what works.

Outside of work, I'm passionate about continuous self-improvement and have long been drawn to practices and philosophies that help cultivate clarity, calm, and deliberate action--including mindfulness and Objectivism. I take an evidence-based approach to everything I do, but I'm just as interested in the big-picture questions: What's worth doing? How do we live with integrity? What makes for a fulfilling life?

My goal through Zey Enterprises is simple--to help people build better systems, make better decisions, and live more consciously in every domain that matters.

If that sounds like what you're after, I'd love to work with you.
