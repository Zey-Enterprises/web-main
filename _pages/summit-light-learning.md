If you're looking for one-on-one math tutoring that's tailored to your needs and actually makes sense, you're in the right place. I specialize in high school math--everything from Algebra I through Pre-Calculus. Whether you're stuck on factoring, confused by functions, or just need someone to help you make sense of what's going on in class, I'm here to help.

I graduated _summa cum laude_ in Mathematics of Computation from UCLA in 2005. But my love for math started way earlier than that--I was the kind of nerd who started Pre-Calculus in 7th grade, and I still watch math YouTube videos for fun.

I tutored throughout college, working with students from elementary school through high school, and I'm excited to return to tutoring with fresh energy and a deep love for the subject.

## What I Offer

* **Algebra I & II**
* **Geometry**
* **Trigonometry**
* **Pre-Calculus**
* **general math enrichment and support**

I believe in helping students not just get the right answers, but really _understand_ the material. I tailor each session to the student's learning style and pace, always aiming to build confidence as well as competence.

## Pricing

My standard rate for in-person tutoring starts at **$90/hour**.

However, I offer discounted rates for students in the Bailey, Pine, and Conifer areas, to make high-quality tutoring more accessible to my local community.

Final pricing may vary, depending on subject matter, travel distance, and frequency of sessions. Please [reach out](/contact/) to discuss your needs, and we can find an arrangement that works for both of us.
