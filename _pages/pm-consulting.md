I help organizations bring clarity, momentum, and user-centered rigor to their digital products.

I've always been obsessed with user experience--both in the physical world and in digital interfaces. Long before I knew product management was a discipline, I found myself drawn to improving tools, optimizing systems, and asking deeper questions about how things could work better, why we were doing them in the first place, and for whom. Whether building tools to automate workflows at work or just obsessing over UX flaws in everyday apps, I've consistently stepped into a product mindset. My journey into formal product management was a natural evolution of these instincts.

With a background spanning startups and major tech companies, I offer cross-functional leadership that bridges product, engineering, design, and business strategy. Whether you're working on an MVP, evolving an existing product, or seeking to refine the user experience of a mature platform, I can help you find clarity, make confident tradeoffs, and move forward with precision.

In 2024, I completed Shreyas Doshi's [Improving Your Product Sense](https://maven.com/shreyas-doshi/product-sense){:target="&lowbar;blank"} course and earned certification in its advanced modules, including positioning, differentiation, segmentation, creative execution, and motivation theory. This experience sharpened my strategic thinking and equipped me with new frameworks for improving product quality, crafting compelling narratives, and understanding user needs with greater depth.

## Deep Experience

I've held product and UX leadership roles at a variety of companies, including:

* **Renaissance Periodization (RP Strength)**<br />I was brought on to help drive development of the [RP Diet Coach App](https://rpstrength.com/pages/diet-coach-app){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, which had seen limited updates for several years. Since joining, I've led the team through substantial improvements and feature launches, and we're currently in beta testing for a major redesign of the app experience.
* **Ookla**<br />As the product manager for the [Speedtest Powered](https://www.ookla.com/speedtest-powered){:target="&lowbar;blank"} suite of products, I led efforts to scale the business and deepen product value for B2B clients, shaping strategy, roadmap, and execution, while working closely with enterprise partners and internal teams.
* **Amazon**<br />At Amazon, I held several senior product management roles on the Alexa team:
  * On **Alexa Core Services**, I defined API strategy and led the design of a scalable API framework, including the Capabilities API, used by millions of Alexa devices.
  * For **Alexa Tech Docs and Developer Experience**, I owned the Alexa Developer Portal, wrote and organized technical documentation, influenced API and architecture design, and drove process improvements across multiple stakeholder teams.
  * On the **Alexa Device SDK** team, I led a unification effort across disjoint SDKs, working with architects and dozens of stakeholders to develop a converged SDK that supported both first- and third-party devices.
* **Autodesk**<br />I worked on developer experience initiatives, including building out the developer portal, designing the monetization strategy, and leading the engineering team in its implementation. I also wrote much of the technical documentation and led the implementation of the docs site I designed.
* **Twitter**<br />Initially a Partner Engineer supporting our B2B partners on new technologies and offerings and essentially wearing a product manager hat, I then became PM and project manager for the developer portal, including technical documentation and app management. I reorganized and rebuilt the site to dramatically improve developer experience, led a major CMS migration, created bug tracking and triage processes, managed marketing page development, and wrote and edited technical documentation.
* **Delphi**<br />I supported Delphi's knowledge management product by analyzing user workflows, shaping requirements, and designing a unified data visualization that represented the intersection of four complex financial classifications—revenue sources, funds, departments, and programs—condensing what previously required hundreds of pages into a single, comprehensible interface.
