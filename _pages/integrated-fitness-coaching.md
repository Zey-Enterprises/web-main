When people hear the word "fitness", they naturally think of diet and exercise--and, to be sure, these are very important to one's wellbeing. But I think that fitness is broader--it includes training the mind, too. And the mind itself is not just one's intellect, but also one's spirit or soul, which, secularly speaking, means one's emotional health and sense of life.

I offer a comprehensive approach to health and wellness that recognizes the deep interconnection between the intellect, body, and spirit. My coaching integrates nutrition and exercise with mindfulness-based practices, emotional support, and guidance in cultivating intellectual clarity and discipline. Whether you're building new habits, pursuing body composition goals, or deepening your self-awareness, I help you engage all aspects of your being in service of lasting, meaningful growth.

The mind and body are distinct (well, somewhat!)--but they are not separate. Each aspect of your being influences the others, and true growth comes from addressing them together. For example, cultivating mindfulness and emotional regulation can help you stay consistent with nutrition and training habits. Physical activity, in turn, can improve mental clarity and emotional resilience. And training your mind to think more critically and independently can empower you to align your life more closely with your values and goals. This holistic, functional approach to wellbeing creates lasting transformation--not just in how you look, but in how you feel, think, live, and _thrive_.

## What I Offer

* **Diet Coaching**<br />Whether you want to lose fat, gain muscle, or maintain a healthy weight and body composition, I can help you craft a nutrition strategy rooted in evidence-based principles and tailored to your goals, lifestyle, and preferences. I am an RP Certified Nutrition Coach and draw on years of experience both personally and professionally in this domain.
* **Exercise Programming**<br />I'll work with you to design a training plan that fits your body, experience level, and schedule--while balancing challenge and sustainability. From resistance training to general physical preparedness, I'll meet you where you are.
* **Mindfulness and Emotional Wellbeing**<br />I offer mindfulness-based coaching that helps you cultivate greater awareness, clarity, and equanimity, so that you can approach life with intentionality and resilience. Whether you're looking to build healthier habits, navigate emotional challenges, or strengthen your relationships, this work centers on deepening your connection to yourself and those around you. After all, true wellbeing starts with presence--and that presence is not just with yourself, but with others, too. Drawing on insights from Attachment Theory, Polyvagal Theory, and Nonviolent Communication, I can support you in working through difficult dynamics with compassion and clarity. This isn't therapy, but it is thoughtful, informed coaching rooted in evidence-based principles and real-life experience.
* **Philosophical Coaching**<br />Just as physical and emotional fitness are vital to wellbeing, so too is intellectual fitness--the ability to think clearly, critically, and independently about the deepest questions in life. I offer guidance and tutoring in core philosophical areas--from metaphysics and epistemology to ethics and politics--drawing on my deep, decades-long background in Objectivism, a philosophy grounded in reality and dedicated to practical success and flourishing. I'm a graduate of the Objectivist Academic Center, founded and led UCLA's Objectivist Club (LOGIC), and actively participate in study groups and book clubs that continue to inform my thinking.

I bring the same analytical rigor, empathy, and obsession with user experience to fitness coaching that I bring to my work in tech. You'll get no bro-science or one-size-fits-all plans here. Instead, I aim to help you understand your body and mind betterâ€”so you can take control of your health with confidence.

Some clients come to me with a specific goal--like getting leaner or building muscle. Others want to focus on stress, consistency, or emotional resilience. Others still want understand how to think more carefully about abstract philosophical issues. Many find value in exploring how all of these are connected.

Whatever your starting point, I'm here to support your evolution.
