If you're aiming for a job at a top-tier tech company or simply want to sharpen your résumé and interviewing skills, I can help.

I bring years of experience on both sides of the hiring table, having worked at a range of impactful and high-performance companies, including **Amazon**, **Twitter**, **Autodesk**, and **Ookla**.

At Amazon, I served on multiple hiring committees and was certified in their rigorous internal programs: **MGHD (Making Good Hiring Decisions)** and **SFI (SDE Functional Interviewing)**. I was also on track to join Amazon's prestigious **Bar Raiser** program before deciding to leave the company.

Beyond my own interview experience, I've helped numerous candidates refine their résumés, prepare for tough behavioral and technical interviews, and successfully land job offers. I understand what top companies are really looking for and how to frame your experience and potential in a way that stands out.

## What I Offer

* **Resume Review**: in-depth feedback on structure, language, formatting, and strategic content to align with your goals
* **Interview Preparation**:
  * behavioral (eg, "Tell me about a time when...")
  * technical problem-solving
  * functional and communication skills
  * mock interviews with detailed feedback
* **Hiring Process Insight**: learn how hiring decisions are actually made at companies like Amazon

Whether you're preparing for your first job out of school or trying to level up into a senior or leadership role, I tailor my coaching to your unique background and ambitions.
