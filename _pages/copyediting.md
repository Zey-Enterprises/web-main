# {{ page.title }}

If you care about clear, compelling, and grammatically accurate communication, you're speaking my language; if you're looking for sharp, thoughtful, and precise editing, you're in the right place.

I bring a lifelong passion for language, paired with deep experience in both formal and informal writing contexts.

I'm a lifelong writing nerd with a sharp editorial eye. I graduated from UCLA School of Law, earned a philosophy certification through a rigorous extracurricular program, and have spent much of my career helping companies and individuals refine their written communication. At tech companies like Amazon, Twitter, Autodesk, Ookla, and Renaissance Periodization, I've often found myself jumping in to write or edit technical documentation, customer-facing messaging, and internal content, even when it wasn't in my official job description.

Whether it's technical writing, marketing copy, or high-stakes documents like grant proposals or [résumés](/career-coaching/), I take pride in precision, clarity, and tone. My friends and colleagues will tell you I'm a bit persnickety about language--and they'll also tell you that's a feature, not a bug.

## What I Offer

- **Copyediting**: grammar, punctuation, word choice, clarity, and style consistency
- **Line Editing**: sentence-level improvements for tone, flow, and readability
- **Structural Feedback**: suggestions for improving organization and impact
- **Collaborative Rewriting**: help refining your own drafts while maintaining your voice
- **Specialized Content Support**: experience with technical, academic, marketing, and product documentation

If you're looking for someone who obsesses over em-dashes, serial commas, and dangling modifiers so you don't have to--I'm your guy.

Let's make your writing shine.
